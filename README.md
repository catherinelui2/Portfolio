# Responsive
Week 2 Homework 

## What is this for?
This is a mobile responsive Student Portfolio that includes three different html pages.
About Me (Index); Portfolio; Contact.

We are currently building the framework of our student portfoilio, so that we can practice utiltizing boostrap as well as getting ready to display our future projects.

## What I have done thus far
Since we are in our early stage of the bootcamp, we have not had a chance to start our projects yet.
That's why you will only see actual data within the Contact and About Me pages.


## Boostrap contents
- Bootstrap grid systems
- Cardstack style was used for my portfolio layout
- Navbar are the same across 3 web pages, it is also mobile responsive to switch to toggler when it is in mobile viewport.
- Sticky footer are also the same across the board.
- About me includes an image of me and my contact info that would direct you to email, github and linkedin.
- Added message form within contact page to allow user to submit a message. (Is not functional yet, haven't learned that yet)
- I also added my own CSS stylesheet to override small things like align text and background color of each page.
